# 🛡️ Fake Email Detection Web Application

A Machine Learning–based web application that detects phishing and fake emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This project combines ML model training + saved model + web deployment, making it a full end-to-end system.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a system that can analyze email text and predict whether it is:

- Legitimate (Safe Email)  
- Phishing / Fake (Malicious Email)  

This helps in understanding how ML can be used in cybersecurity and fraud detection.
